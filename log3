For this week on my log I will tell you how I progressed through my website
and figured out how to use it.

This week I actually started to use the Wix webiste creator to create my website.
Im starting wo make a lot of progress creating the main page and making it look
good and viewable. I ran into a problem with the actual use of the riddles though.
Im gonna have to put disclaimers up because most of the riddles won't be my own but
others that have thought up of the riddles. (I will put up links for the videos, and
the original websites I found the riddles on).
