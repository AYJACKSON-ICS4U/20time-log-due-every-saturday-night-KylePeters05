During these 4 weeks I searched around to find Riddles. I want to find a vast amount of riddles so I can have enough riddles for 
certain subjects, such as kids riddles, hard riddles, video riddles, and so on... By the end of the tenth week of doing this I want to have
all of my riddles found and then try to add them to my website.

Hi Kyle,
I suggest you look at what a Koan is. 
This might have the educational power you are looking for.
If you start to store knowledge and interest(especially mathematical) "within" a Koan...
You might find successes.

Maybe you might be interested in trying these Koans, using Git.

Just an idea.

Keep up the good work!
