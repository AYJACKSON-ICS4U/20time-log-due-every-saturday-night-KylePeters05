  For my 20Time project (1st week) I am starting to scout out different website creaters (such as Wix or just normal google website)
and finding which one will be a good fit for a website. I have also started planning out how my website will work out. Whether it be a 
review site like rotten tomatoes or just a website where you enter in info and the website then pops out a suggested movie for you.
For next wekk I am planning on finding a website creator website to use (probaly Wix) and watching some videos on how to make a website
the way I want to make it.
