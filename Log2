For this log I will tell you what I did on my second week for my 20Time
project.

For this week I changed what I was gonna do from a website that suggests
movies, to a website that will have riddles on it. I also figured out what
website I was gonna use to make my website so others can view it. I choose
this website because it looks more proffessional and is easy to work on.
Plus there are lots of tutorials for this website and how to use it.
